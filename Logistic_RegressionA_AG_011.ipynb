        "Question 1: What is Logistic Regression, and how does it differ from Linear\n",
        "Regression?\n",
        "- Ans: Logistic Regression is a method used when we want to predict categories, usually two types like yes/no, pass/fail, or spam/not spam. It works by giving a probability between 0 and 1, and then we decide which category it belongs to.\n",
        "It is different from Linear Regression because Linear Regression predicts numbers, while Logistic Regression predicts probabilities for categories. Also, Linear Regression can give any value, but Logistic Regression uses a special curve called the sigmoid function to keep predictions between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 2: Explain the role of the Sigmoid function in Logistic Regression.\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "- The Sigmoid function in Logistic Regression changes any number into a value between 0 and 1. This is important because we want our model to predict probabilities for categories.\n",
        "If the output is close to 1, it means high probability for one class (like “yes”), and if it’s close to 0, it means high probability for the other class (like “no”). The sigmoid curve is S-shaped, so small changes in input near the middle can cause big changes in probability, which helps in decision-making.\n",

        "\n",
        "Question 3: What is Regularization in Logistic Regression and why is it needed?\n",
        "- Answer:\n",
        "Regularization in Logistic Regression is a technique used to prevent the model from overfitting. Overfitting happens when the model learns too much from the training data, including the noise, and performs badly on new data.\n",
        "Regularization works by adding a penalty to the model’s coefficients (weights) so they don’t become too large. This keeps the model simpler and improves its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Question 4: What are some common evaluation metrics for classification models, and\n",
        "why are they important?\n",
        "- Answer:Some common evaluation metrics for classification models are Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.\n",
        "They are important because they help us understand how well the model is performing. For example, Accuracy tells how many predictions are correct, Precision shows how many predicted positives are actually positive, Recall shows how many actual positives the model found, F1-score balances Precision and Recall, and ROC-AUC measures the model’s ability to distinguish between classes. Using these metrics gives a complete picture of model performance instead of relying on just one measure.\n",
